This projects aims to gain greater understanding into the different NBA positions. There are 5 positions in the NBA (point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center).

This is a classification task, predicting a player’s position based on their seasonal statistics. Data was scraped from basketball-reference.com
